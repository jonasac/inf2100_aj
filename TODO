TODO:
    * javadocs everywhere:
	Cflat.java [x] jonas
	Scanner.java [_] alexander
	CharGenerator.java [x] (dont know if we should comment the already provided methods, commented the ones we changed and implemented)
    * check that the precode is still there in:
	Cflat.java [x] jonas
	Scanner.java [_] (should be checked once more)
	CharGenerator.java [x] jonas
