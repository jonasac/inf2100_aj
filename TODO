TODO:
    * javadocs everywhere:
	Cflat.java [_]
	Scanner.java [x]
	CharGenerator.java [x]
    * check that the precode is still there in:
	Cflat.java [x] jonas
	Scanner.java [_] (should be checked once more)
	CharGenerator.java [x] jonas
    * Better error messages we need to implement something here
    * Logging to file instead of stdout (with flush) (depending on what is intended by the assignment)
    * Doublecheck that it works
    * See wether we need to do something about the Errors Class (WE DO i checked :p)
