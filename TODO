TODO:
    * javadocs everywhere:
	Cflat.java [_]
	Scanner.java [_] alexander
	CharGenerator.java [x] (dont know if we should comment the already provided methods, commented the ones we changed and implemented)
    * check that the precode is still there in:
	Cflat.java [_]
	Scanner.java [_]
	CharGenerator.java [_]
    * Better error messages
    * Logging to file instead of stdout (with flush) (depending on what is intended by the assignment)
    * Doublecheck that it works
    * See wether we need to do something about the Errors Class
