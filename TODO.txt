TODO:
    * javadocs everywhere:
	Cflat.java [_]
	Scanner.java [_]
	CharGenerator.java [_]
    * check that the precode is still there in:
	Cflat.java [_]
	Scanner.java [_]
	CharGenerator.java [_]
    * Better error messages
    * Logging to file instead of stdout (with flush)
    * Doublecheck that it works
